#1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
# -define a method that takes two Integers as arguments
# -then add those two integers together
# end

# START
# def method (Integer1, Integer2)
# Integer1 + Integer 2
# END


#2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all
#   those strings concatenated together 
# -define a method that takes an array as an argument
# -turn the array into a regular string
# - add all the strings together to form one big string
# - return the string

# START
# def method (argument)
# METHOD that turns argument into a string from an array
# METHOD or + sign that combines all of the strings together
# return string
# END



#3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every
#   other element
# - define a method that accepts an array as an argument
# - select every other element 
# - return every other element into a new array

# def method (argument)
# use select method and another to find every third element
# set this selection to a new variable
# return new array
# END
